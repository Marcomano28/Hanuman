# Hanuman Face Generator 
  ## Introduction
This project utilizes a mathematical function F() to generate a visual pattern resembling the face of Hanuman on an HTML canvas. This README provides a brief overview of the process.
## Algorithm
The core of this project relies on the F() function, which is a mathematical algorithm. While the specific details of the algorithm are complex and not fully explained here, it is responsible for generating the intricate patterns that form the image.
## Usage
This project is written in pure JavaScript (Vanilla JS). To view the Hanuman face pattern:

. Clone the repository to your local machine.

. Open the HTML file (index.html) in your web  browser.

## Notes
This project is based on mathematical computations and may require some understanding of the algorithm to make adjustments or modifications.

The exact interpretation of the generated pattern as the face of Hanuman is subjective and may vary among viewers.
